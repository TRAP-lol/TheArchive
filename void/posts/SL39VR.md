Trying to relive a memory from text, a strange feeling to be sure. Wanting to understand you from the past. Doing so successfully and yet failing at the same time. Would you be able to help the you from the past? would you even be able to pinpoint the change in your life that changed everythig, and if you could, could you truly verbalize the meaning behind it.

What if we return to being that person. Is a portal to the past something to be played with. Can you admire the progress or do you miss where you used to be, who you used to be. Such a strong part of your identity, possibly removed, so now what do you do. Who are you.
