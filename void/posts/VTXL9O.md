# Yes / No / Maybe

Why can one be in two contradictory states at the same time.
Being completely aware that your states conflict, yet not feeling able to change it.
More than wanting either state, more like being content with either state.
Accepting one or the other, not rejecting either, but being in a place of peace regardless.

It makes you positive, brightens your day, gives you hope.
You wonder about both possibilities, daydreaming.
Sometimes you get more exited for one, though you find rest again after some time has passed.

Cant force either option, that would destroy the possibility of both options.
You just have to see what realizes, what comes to be, universally requiring patience.
