# How is life

In shadows deep, where sorrow breeds

A weary soul, consumed by need

A heart that longs for solace true

Weight that burdens on the chest

Where contemplation lies and keeps the heart from rest

One so deep in thought, they can not breath

Fragments of dreams scattered afar

There is darkness, a seed of death

One may ly and finally rest

The soul is broken

Pieces blown, from right to left

A tormented mind, a heavy breath

Seeking something to bring them rest
