I am so tired. Every day, mid day, it hits. A wave of tired. Making me want to do absolutely nothing. Not even doom scroll.

It makes me feel utterly useless. My life is a waste, I am achieving nothing, and going nowhere, learning nothing new, nor revising past information. Just being, wanting to sleep. Not even, it goes beyond that. A tiredness beyond needing sleep. One that hits deep within my soul. Like a dark mist that surrounds me. Preventing any sunlight from reaching my skin.

It hurts. I suffer. Agitation, frustration, discontentment, all emotions that flow through me while I just sit and watch myself from outside. Wanting to move but being immobile.

The universe is unimaginable, yet I am too tired to explore.
