Something that can make you so happy. Feeling like the world loves you. Everything around you is perfect, and so is everyone else.

Colors appear vibrant. Movement feels nice, your body feels newly discovered.

I dare want to stay in that state for ever. Knowing full well that would cause the magic to be lost.

The days that follow remind you of the price you must pay for that short-term relief. They remind you why you try to escape in the first place.

Knowing such a state can exist within the mind is absolutely beautiful though. Regardless of the cost. It gives you hope that you can feel alright. It makes you feel as if you are allowed to be loved, by yourself and others.

Its not the most healthy of approaches, and you need to understand the days that follow are pure hell. The experience though, the shift in perception, the altered world view, it is beautiful.
