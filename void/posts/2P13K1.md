Life is strange. There is so much to do, yet I find myself in the same repetitive loop of actions. Like having a full catalogue of series to watch, but returning to the show you have streamed many times over before. 

Finding comfort in that which feels familiar. No suprises. 

Listening to the same songs over and over, currating a playlist of songs to just leave on repeat. 

Yet so much of my now is because it was at one stage, new. 

Do you even get to create what is your comfort. It always feels like such a struggle against what I want and what I end up doing. Like a disconnect between what I can get myself to do, and what I actually want to do.
