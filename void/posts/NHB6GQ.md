> Characterized by or subject to rapid or unexpected change

Unexpected change, expected unexpected change. It's the same thing. It's like a paradox, a contradiction, a mind bending puzzle. It's like a riddle that can't be solved. It's like a question that can't be answered. It's like a thought that can't be understood. It's like a feeling that can't be felt.

The only thing that is certain is that everything is uncertain. It is not always easy to see the change in ourselves, to see the change in others.

The truth is, everything is uncertain. The only certainty lies in the fact that nothing remains the same forever. We may resist the shifts, holding tightly to what we know, but change persists. It persists in molding our paths, redirecting our course, and leaving us bewildered in its wake.

Being subject to the unknown, is frightening. Spending lifetimes trying to control everything, only to be subject to the inevitable.

It's like trying to hold water in your hands. You can try to cup your hands to contain it, but it will always slip through your fingers.
