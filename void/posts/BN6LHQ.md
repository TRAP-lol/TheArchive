Where do I find myself today

This has been a involved journey. Everything around me has shifted slightly, and it all feels like it is turning barely fast enough for me to witness it.

I am not no longer just one, but I am more, I am appart of a unity, I no longer fight only for myself. This is a crushing change to accept. A life long acknowledgement of loneliness now needing to be silenced.

What is next I do not know
