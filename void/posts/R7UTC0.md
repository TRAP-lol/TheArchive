I live in the future, and I dont mean, "Oh I constantly look towards the future".
I mean I actually live in the future. I see it happening, feel it happening, watch it happen.
Living my life today, watching the me of tomorrow. Theres nothing like this. It brings a wave of sadness.
Watching yourself from the present looking towards the future looking back towards the past.
It brings joy as well though, a sense of relief, that every moment now, will be okay. The pain, the suffering, the struggles of life and the mind,
they are only temporary. One day you will have the privilege of looking back towards today, and knowing it is over.

That's something, something hard to accept, yet easy and peaceful to feel.
Thousands of tiny little emotions bubbling their way up towards the surface of your heart.
Letting you know they exist, even though you don't know their name.

One day it will be tomorrow no more. One day time will end for us, for me, and I watch myself today from tomorrow.
Both accepting and feeling shame for my actions, however observing my actions today such that tomorrow I can understand.

One day tomorrow will be no more.
