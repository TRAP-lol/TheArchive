Sometimes a person gets mad.
Mad for no reason at all.
An innocents voice, brings out the worst in you.

A person unknowingly destroying real estate within your mind.
You don't know why, and that makes the situation even worse for yourself.
An impulsive panic, upbringing deep trauma, perhaps unrelated to the victim.

Why can one person make you feel this way, why can you treat an individual with so much injustice.
To not be in control of your emotions, to allow them to spike, possibly extend into the lives around you.
Knowing very well you are in the wrong.
Yet not being able to change it.

I don't know what to do, it angers me to feel anger.
Compounding its effects.

If only I would hold my hand before my mouth, and let my emotions get released elsewhere.

Hate gets brought up because of this lack of control.
Only making the emotion stronger.
