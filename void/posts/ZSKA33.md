My day has been the start of hopefully something perpetual. Making me work towards a goal in life to allow those around me in my life the kind of life they deserve. I hope to make this feeling of want, to last. To make this feeling of wanting to do, last.

I go through life always wanting to do, yet never able to. This time I hope I can be that change, if not for me, for those I care deeply for. My life should at least mean that much
